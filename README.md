	The first two days of the project I decided to work primarly on HTML and Jquery, 
	so I could lay out the structure of the website and add functionality to it.
	
	I first tried to use the same CSS file for the home page and to the projects, eventually I realized it
	would be really hard do keep the variables and the elements separate when styling. 
	
	I left Friday to the major CSS part of the page... It took me a lot of back and forth to decide the color
	scheme and everything else. 
	
	I also added some media query to make sure the website would be functional on every device. It wasnt as painful or
	hard as i thought it would be, since I decided to use mainly percentage/vh/wh/rem as unit of measure.
